Objective: To configure a secure firewall on an Ubuntu machine, allowing or denying services and traffic as required.

Requirements:

1)Basic understanding of Linux commands
2)Ubuntu system (physical or virtual)
3)Root or sudo access

Key Steps:

1)Update System Packages – Ensures system packages are current.
2)Install UFW – Installs UFW if not pre-installed on the system.
3)Enable UFW – Activates UFW to start managing incoming and outgoing traffic.
4)Configure Rules – Allows or denies access based on services, ports, IP addresses, or subnets(command: sudo ufw allow/deny port/ip address) .
5)Firewall Status Check – Provides the current status and rules configured.

Testing:
Testing is performed using nmap to scan for open ports and confirm that UFW rules are applied correctly.
